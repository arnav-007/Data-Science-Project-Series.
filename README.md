# DOCUMENTATION

## 1) Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

* Installed necessary libraries for analysis.

* Checked for null values and outliers in the dataset.



## 2) Dataset Manipulation:


* Created a new dataset with selected columns.

* Introduced a new column, "tomorrow," by shifting 
  values.










## 3) Target Variable Creation:


* Generated a new column, "target value," indicating 
  day-to-day change in stock price as boolean values.






## 4) Data Splitting:

* Divided the dataset into training and testing sets, 
  using the first 100 rows for training and the last 100 rows for testing.





## 5) Modeling:

* Employed various machine learning models, including 
  Random Forest, XGB Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier.




## 6) Model Evaluation:

* Assessed the accuracy of each model.
* Identified XGB Classifier as the best-performing 
   model.
